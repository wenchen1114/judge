It feels like I was in a dark dark dark abyss. Then I was kidnapped by The Monk and held captive in the tower until my wife, Miss White and Miss Teal came to rescue me.",

We lived so happily together, and the monk just took my husband away! If I can never see Xu xian again just because I am a snake…I couldn’t help but to save my husband with all my power.

          "Answer": "Miss White was forced to turn into her original snake form from the potion The Monk gave Xu Xian. As a result, Xu Xian was scared to death. She had to get the fairy herb to bring him back to life. I know it is against the rule to bring a normal person back to life. But if you have only known their love and commitment for each other…\nAnd the rest is history. The Monk kidnapped Xu Xian to lure Miss White out. He was killing Miss White. He wanted to capture her and kidnap her for eternity.",

          "Answer": "The Monk was casting some spell on her so that she is paralysed from her power. I couldn’t let that happen so I threw a blunt object towards him to distract him. Miss White got the chance to escape from the spell. She casted the ultimate spell to fight against The Monk and it happened to be the flooding spell.",

          "Question": "Could you describe what happened? ",
          "Answer": "I was trying my best to prevent Miss White from being in contact with Xu Xian since what’s best for him is to be a normal person. His life is already complicated enough. There is no need for him to deal with the supernatural incidents in his life. The Miss Teal distracted me with a rock and then last I remembered was the flooding. ",

What’s more, she murdered all the innocent creatures that are in the village. There are always consequences to one’s actions. I believe Miss White should be punished.",
